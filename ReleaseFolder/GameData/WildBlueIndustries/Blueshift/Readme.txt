Changes

- Added new entry for settings.cfg: interstellarResourceConsumptionModifier. This modifier reduces the resources required to power warp engines while in interstellar space. It is a percentage value between 0 and 99.999. The default value is 10. You can override this global setting by specifying this value in the WBIWarpEngine config.

- WBIWarpEngine: Added new interstellarResourceConsumptionModifier that will reduce the resource consumption of all WBIModuleGeneratorFX part modules when the vessel is in interstellar space. This is a percentage value between 0 and 99.999. The default is 10, meaning that all generators will reduce their input resource consumption by 10% while keeping the output rates the same.

Bottom line: This reduction will enable ships to consume less graviolium while out in interstellar space.
