Changes

- The auto-circularize PAW button won't appear unless you're in planetary space or in interplanetary space and the star has no planets.
- There's an easter egg built into auto-circularization. I'm sure it won't take long for people to figure it out. :)
- Fixed issue with starships "warp dragging" other starships around that are in physics range.
- Fixed issue with last planet overrides where the parent star was mistakenly added as the last planet.
