Changes

- Rearranged warp engine FTL pre-flight checks to provide more accurate readings.
- Added status texts to the warp speed harvester.
- Fixed issue where warp engines couldn't draw their required Electric Charge "propellant" requirements.
- Fixed issue with deprecated parts causing ship loading errors.
- Fixed issue where engineers were adding way too much of a speed bonus to the warp engines (should be 1% bonus per engineering star).
