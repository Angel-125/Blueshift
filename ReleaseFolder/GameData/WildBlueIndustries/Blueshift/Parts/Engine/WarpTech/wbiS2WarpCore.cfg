// Normally, as you go down in size categories (Size 3 -> Size 2/Mk2 -> Size 1 -> Size 0) the performance of a warp engine, warp core, or warp coil drops as well to 25% of the higher-up size category. But you can increase the performance if you also increase the cost. For every percent increase, multiply the unlock and purchase price by an equal percentage. For example, the S-2 Warp Core has 75% of the performance of the S-3 Warp Core instead of the normal 25%. We added 50% performance increase, so we multiply its base costs by 1.5.
