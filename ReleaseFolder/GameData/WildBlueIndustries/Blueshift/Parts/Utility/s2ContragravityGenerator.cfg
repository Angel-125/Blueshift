	description = The Contragravity Generator effectively reduces the forces of gravity that act upon a vessel. As a result, the vessel will need less delta-v to achieve orbit and/or deorbit and land. It can negate up to 1g of gravity, but a ship with multiple generators can negate multiple gees. If the amount of gravity that can be negated exceeds the local gravity, then at most 95% of the local gravity will be negated regardless of how many generators a vessel has.
